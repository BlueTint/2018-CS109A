            "1. Use an index: If you have a large number of nodes in your database, using an index on the label property can significantly speed up your query. You can create an index on the label property like this:\n",

A label scan will only look at nodes with the specified label, which can be faster than scanning all nodes in the database. You can use a label scan like this:\n",
